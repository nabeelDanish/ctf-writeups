# Lab: User ID controlled by request parameter

## Steps:

1. Login with the credentials
2. See that the id is supplied in the query parameters
3. Observe that this id is a UUID so that means we cannot find `carlos` id
4. Find a blog post by `carlos`
5. Inspect the HTML, you will find his `guid`
6. Use the `guid` when clicking on the accounts page to login as `carlos`
